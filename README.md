## 📌 Project Overview

Time series forecasting is widely used for predicting trends in finance, sales, energy consumption, and many real-world scenarios. In this project:

- We explore and visualize the time series data
- Perform stationarity checks and differencing
- Build and tune **ARIMA** and **SARIMAX** models
- Compare forecasting accuracy
- Generate forecast plots for future time periods
